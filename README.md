# Game Of Life

<p> This project is a C++ implementation of the famous cellular automaton game, Conway's Game Of Life. It's built using a version of my game engine, Endeavor, which is currently being rewritten as a more general-purpose library.</p>

<p> The logic of the game itself is all crammed into scripts/Grid.hpp. Camera movement is in scripts/CameraController.hpp. Given more time I would refactor much of the code in these scripts, but for now I'd like to move to new projects.<p>
